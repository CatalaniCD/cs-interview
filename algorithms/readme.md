# Concepts on Algorithms

1. Logarithmic Time #
2. DFS : Depth First Search @
3. BFS :  Bredth First Search @
5. Binary Search -> O(log_2 n) #
6. Manipulate many pointers at the same time -> Sliding window -> use of 2 pointers / longest palindromic substring
7. Recursion -> Logic of recursion @
8. Inverting a Binary Tree / Linked List @.5
9. Suffix Tree
10. Heaps -> Binary Heaps / Binary Trees
11. Dinamic Programming -> Memoization / Fibonacci
12. Balanced Brackets Problem -> Solve by using a stack @
13. Hash Tables -> Use of DFS and keep track of visited nodes (Histogram or Dictionary)
14. Sorting Algorithms -> Understand Runtime and Why
15. Custom DataStructure that makes easier to solve a problem -> Generators @

## Extras
1. N-ary Tree DFS @
2. N-ary Tree BFS @
